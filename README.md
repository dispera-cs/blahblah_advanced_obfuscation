# Purpose
The purpose of this Python script is to obfuscate the target Python script. Various obfuscation methods are used, including: Marshalling Obfuscation, Constant String Encryption, Dynamic Code Generation, and Control Flow Obfuscation. The code is saved in an obfuscated file.

# How do I make it work?
You need to enter the directory path of the Python scripts that you want to obfuscate while using the scripts. The script reads the target script's source code, applies the obfuscation changes, and creates an obfuscated copy. Obfuscation can make code difficult to understand or change, and is typically used to protect code. However, it does not provide complete security. Please use this script with caution and follow the law and morals when working with code.

# Disclaimer
Obfuscate code for the purpose of harming or offending others
